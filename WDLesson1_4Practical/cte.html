<p>Computer programming and web design are intertwined disciplines that focus on creating and maintaining software and websites. Computer programming is the process of writing code that tells a computer how to perform specific tasks and functions. 
  Web design, on the other hand, involves the visual aesthetics, layout, and overall user experience of a website, using tools and languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and functional digital presence. </p>
